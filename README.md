## üöÄ About The Project

This project serves as a comprehensive log and practical playground for my exploration into AI-native application development. It aims to document my progress, experiments, and insights gained while working with AI models, frameworks, and tools.

* **What it does:** This repository will contain code samples, project ideas, learning resources, notes, and potentially small proof-of-concept applications related to AI-native development.
* **Why it's useful:** It acts as a personal learning journal, a reference point for future projects, and a way to share my journey and discoveries with the community.
* **Target Audience:** Myself (for structured learning), other learners interested in AI-native development, and anyone curious about practical applications of AI.

### Built With

* Python
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Various AI/ML Libraries (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers, LlamaIndex - *to be added as I learn*)
* Git & GitHub
* Cursor (for development)
---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Structured Learning Path:** Organized sections for different AI-native concepts.
* **Code Examples:** Practical code snippets demonstrating AI model interactions and application patterns.
* **Project Showcase:** Small, focused projects to apply learned concepts.
* **Resource Curation:** Collection of valuable articles, tutorials, and documentation.
* **Personal Notes & Insights:** My reflections and understanding of complex topics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Since this is primarily a learning repository, "installation" mainly involves setting up your development environment to run the code examples.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+ (recommended to use a virtual environment)
* pip (Python package installer)
* Git
* Cursor (for an enhanced AI-native development experience)
* (Optional) Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AI_Native_Journey.git](https://github.com/your-username/AI_Native_Journey.git)

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd AI_Native_Journey

# 3. (Recommended) Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 4. Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
# .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# 5. Install core dependencies (specific to your current projects)
# For example, if you start with OpenAI API:
pip install openai

# Or for a general set of tools:
# pip install -r requirements.txt 
# (You will create this file as you add more dependencies)

# 6. Set up environment variables (if applicable, e.g., API keys)
# Create a .env file in the root directory (do NOT commit this to Git!)
# Example:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_openai_key_here
